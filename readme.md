# Visual layout

## Base layer

- `Gesc` = Escape when pressed, ` when Shift or GUI are held.
- `Rs Enter` = Right Shift when held, Enter when tapped.
- `Ctrl Del` = Right Control when held, Delete when tapped.
- `Nav` = Navigate layer when held Tab or ' when tapped.
- `Lower` &dArr; and `Raise` &uArr; are layer keys.
- `Lower` &dArr; is Tap toggle = Acts like a Momentarily layer unless itâ€™s tapped multiple times, which toggles the layer on.

- `Game` and `NumPad` are toggle layers keys.


# Layout goals and thoughts
I felt the need to have access to `Enter` with both hands and using the thumb for `Enter` feels better but I still use the Shift/Enter key sometimes.

The game layer is mainly for csgo and apex legends since in other games I didn't feel the need, `1234` is used to cycle through weapons and utilities, so far I didn't find a comfortable spot for the `4` key because of that I am rebinding ingame to a mouse button instead.

  [^1]: you can use [Vial](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-gui) to configure the keymap without having to recompile and reflash.
